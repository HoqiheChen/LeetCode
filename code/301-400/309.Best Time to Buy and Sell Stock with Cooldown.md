# 62. Unique Paths

## Description:

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

## Brief:

买卖股票问题：可以多次买卖，每次卖完之后有一个1天的冷却。

## Input:

[1,2,3,0,2]

## Output:

3 

## Explanation:

transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

## Ideas:

有买，卖和冷却三个变量。

买的最大价值为：冷却的最大价值减去当前i天的价格。

冷却的最大价值为：卖的最大价值。

卖的最大价值为：买的最大价值加上当天i天的价格。

## Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length < 2){
            return 0;
        }
        int buy = -prices[0];
        int sell = 0;
        int cool = 0;
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1;i < prices.length;i ++){
            buy = Math.max(buy,cool - prices[i]);
            cool = Math.max(cool,sell);
            sell = Math.max(sell,buy + prices[i]);
            result = Math.max(result,sell);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
