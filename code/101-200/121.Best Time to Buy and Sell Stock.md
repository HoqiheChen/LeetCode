# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Description:

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

## Brief:

第i天买入股票，第j天卖出股票，且i<j。求股票的最大盈利，若亏损，最大盈利为0。

## Input:

（1）[7,1,5,3,6,4]

（2）[7,6,4,3,1]

## Output:

（1）5

（2）0

## Explanation:

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Ideas:

找出后边的最大值与前边最小值的差。
## Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int buy = prices[0];
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for(int i = 1;i < prices.length;i ++){
            if(prices[i] < buy){
                buy = prices[i];
            }else{
                if(prices[i] - buy > maxprofit){
                    maxprofit = prices[i] - buy;
                }
            }
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
}
```
